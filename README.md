# SmartHome-Gesture-Control-Application-
CSE 535 : Mobile Computing


Purpose:  

Students will develop an application service that will control SmartHome devices with gestures. 
Students will gain hands-on experience developing a mobile application using Android Studio. 
This project, and its successful completion, provides an excellent opportunity to gain further 
exposure to relevant topics and applications in the area of mobile computing. 

Technology Requirements:  
● Android Studio 
● Either MatLab or Python 

Project Description:  

For Part 1: 
A. The user is shown a video of a gesture.  
B. The user can replay the video at least 3 times.  
C. Upon clicking the “PRACTICE” button, the user can capture his or her own video through 
the smartphone’s front camera for a period of at most 5 seconds. 
D. The videos are uploaded to a server. 

The mobile application should have three (3) screens: 
1. Screen 1:​ A drop-down menu of 17 different gestures will be shown on this screen. 
Once a single gesture is selected, the user will be taken to Screen 2.
● Gesture list: {Turn on lights, Turn off lights, Turn on fan, Turn off fan, Increase fan 
speed, decrease fan speed, Set Thermostat to specified temperature, gestures 
one for each digit 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} 
2. Screen 2:​ The video of an expert performing the gesture will be shown on this screen.  
Screen 2 will have another button that says “PRACTICE”. Once this button is pressed, 
the user will be taken to Screen 3. 
3. Screen 3:​ In this screen, the camera interface will be opened for the user to record the 
practice gesture.
 
Screen 3 will have another button that says “UPLOAD”. Once this button is pressed, the 
user will be able to upload the gesture to a local server. Moreover, clicking this button 
will take the user back to Screen 1.
